Tricks

Backtrack:
  - 8 queens problems using bitmask
    - only n bits bitmask for left and right diagonal
    - iterate through all k set bits in O(k)
  - is better than complete iterative search of all subsets(filtering): 
    - if early pruning pruning possible
    - also dp could be used for small states

DP:
  - prefixsum, kadane's algorithm: 1D O(n) and 2D O(n^3) 
  - O(nlogk) output-sensitvie LIS (only works for strictly increasing sequence)
  - ways for coin change (bottom-up approach using O(n) space)
  - bitmask for state

Graph Traversal:

  -Connected components(dfs/bfs): count number components in graph
  -Floodfill(dfs)
    - trick to explore 2D grid (N, S, W, E ...)
    - count size of connected component while labeling.
  -topological sort
    -Method1: Tarjan's algorithm: (DFS) post order traversal
    -Method2: Kahn's algorithm(similar to bfs). Use if there are constraints on the sort order.
    -use backtrack to find all sorts
